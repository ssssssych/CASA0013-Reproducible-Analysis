Executive Summary

Airbnb, a platform for short-term rentals, has been growing in popularity in recent years, particularly in urban areas. As a result, it has had a significant impact on the housing market in the large world city, London. London is an unequal city with high housing costs, quickly rising rents, a significant income gap, a pronounced social class divide, and multidimensional gentrification that is seen in the city's urban structure (Watt & Minton, 2016). The emergence of Airbnb has added to the existing complexity of the London housing market (Shabrina, Arcaute & Batty, 2022). 

The main purpose of this article explores the impact of Airbnb on London house prices by building multiple linear regression model at the scale of the borough. In the following section 2&3, the used data and fundamental methodology will be introduced. In section 4, the results will be presented and discussed in the context of multiple regression analysis. Section 5 will discuss implications and recommendations of the results for Airbnb regulatory policy and the London real estate market. Finally, some conclusive remarks will be drawn. 要详细一点写如何分析的以及结果，扩写。

Literature review 

Some studies shows that the presence of Airbnb has a driving effect on housing prices. Barron et al. (2021) argued that the presence of Airbnb listings raises housing costs and rent in US cities. Furthermore, due to Airbnb, home values rose by around 31% (Sheppard & Udell, 2016). Todd et al. (2022) showed that between the prevalence of Airbnb and the average housing price per square meter in these boroughs, there is a strong and slight positive correlation. Using web-scraped data from Airbnb and property-level data from the city, Zou (2019) investigated the net impact of STRs on single-family property prices through a series of hedonic analyses. It turned out that owning an Airbnb location nearby can significantly drive up real estate prices.

There are also negative effects. Cheung's (2022) study of the Auckland region of New Zealand revealed that the introduction of Airbnb revealed safety concerns for homeowners , a potential increase in crime rates, and a significant negative impact on the price of flat housing.

Overview of Airbnb in London (内容时间可以改)

Airbnb is available in all 33 London boroughs, with four main housing types ---- entire homes/ apartment, private rooms, shared rooms and hotel rooms. Boyel's research illustrated that as of September 2022, the numbers of these four room types are 41224, 27479, 404 and 244 respectively. Between 2016 and 2022, the number of Airbnb in London kept increasing in the first 5 years and reach a peak of 87235 in 2020. The number in 2021 dropped rapidly, reduced to approximately 45000 and picked up again in 2022 (Boyel, 2022).

Overview of London housing price (内容时间可以改)

Between 2016 and 2020, the average house prices in London have seen a steady increase. According to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the average price of UK property rose from £483,000 in 2016 to £672,000 in 2020, and this trend is expected to continue in 2021. In London specifically, house prices rose by around 10% each year in the same period (ONS, 2021). This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including increased demand and limited supply, but the presence of Airbnb may also have a role to play.
